Welcome to big data analytic project using Apache Spark.

Olympic games are international sporting events where thousands of athletes from more than 200 countries participate in variety of competitions. Winner, second and third place competitors are awarded gold, silver and bronze medals respectively. Participating in an event and winning medals in olympic games is an aspiration and dream for many people around the world.

The dataset used for this exercise, 'olympix_data.csv' contains data from olympic events between 2000 and 2012 in which athlete has won atleast one medal. Below are the columns available for analysis. The goal of this project is to analyze the data using apache spark and answer the questions that follow therby extracting insights from data.


Important Instructions

* This project needs to be completed in spark environment using either scala or pyspark
* The schema of the dataset needs to match as given in next section.
* The file names to be saved should match EXACTLY the name provided in the instruction including the file extention. i.e. '.csv'
* The records should be ORDERED as per the instruction.
* All the files should be saved along with header information.
* The files should be saved along with 
* Once the hackerrank environment is up, use terminal to bring up scala or pyspark. Type 'pyspark' in terminal to bring up pyspark.  Type 'spark-shell' to bring up scala.

Data Preparation

Before starting with analysis, data needs to be cleaned and prepared. The needed steps are detailed below.

Step 1 - Read the raw data from 'olympix_data.csv' and store it in dataframe with below mentioned schema. The column name and datatypes should match as given below

Step 2 - Check for records with missing value in Age column. Store those records alone to a file named 'datanull.csv'.

Step 3 - Drop the ClosingDate as it is not useful for the following analysis

Step 4 - Drop the records with missing value

Step 5 - Save the cleaned file to 'final_data.csv'. The data available at this step will be used for analytics.
